I need to make my CS IA's Criterion C document and so here's the full code and the file tree structure for the entire application. also, here are some notes for you about the Criterion C document:

Purpose of Criterion C document:

- showcase complexity and reasoning behind that complexity.

Example Complex Techniques (non-exhaustive)

- Usage of Abstract Data Structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, hash tables, etc.)
- Linking to other systems using an API
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Complex algorithmic processes (sorting, manipulating multiple data structures, performing complex calculations, usage of nested loops, etc.)
- Multidimensional data structures
- Multithreading or Multiprocessing
- Recursion
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Complex User Interfaces/User - Interface Libraries
- Use of Web Technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- Use of Web Frameworks (React, Angular, etc.)
- Mobile UI; Techniques related to building mobile applications
- Databases
- Event handlers, callbacks or promises.
- Error handling

Ingenuity

- What does this mean? Who knows.
- Some sources say that ingenuity is basically complexity.
- Other sources see "clean code" as representing ingenuity.
- "Clean code" refers to the usage of professional software development practices.
- Some examples of clean code include:
- Using functions to organize code into a logic set of modules; each function completes one task
- Using OOP as intended to design a logically-organized piece of software
- Error-checking/Error-handling
- Model-View-Controller design pattern implementation or others.
- An effort to make algorithms as efficient as possible
- Use of input validation

Structuring your code explanation

- Based on screenshot
- Should refer to specific lines
- Can be limited to a paragraph
- Give an overview of the function of the code in the screenshot
- Make a mention of how and why the complex technique is used in the code snippet. (very important)

I have also provided the codebase and the file structure.

The first part of my plan to make this document is to firstly identify a whole bunch of techniques first. so lets do that. Here's the plan I have in mind:

- identify all the techniques first (use techniqes.md as prompt)
- decide general presentation structure (Table of Contents)
- decide individual presentation structure. (Eg. images or not, images with annotations or not, etc...)
- writing...

let's get started with laying out all the techniques.
